# Code Book

This code book explains the variables and relevant information in
`UCI-HAR-Dataset.tidy.txt` and `UCI-HAR-Dataset.tidy.mean.txt`

## subject and activity

* subject
* activity

The 'subject' variable can take the value from 1 to 30, and the 'activity' is
one of the following: walking, walking_upstairsr, walking_downstairs, sitting,
standing or laying.

## sensor data

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals
(prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then
they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth
filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the
acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration
signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth
filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in
time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the
magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the
Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag,
tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag,
fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain
signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each
pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and
Z directions. Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement are retained, see the 'Mean' and 'Std' in the feature names.

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is:
